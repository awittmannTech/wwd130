            The website should allow the visitor to see not only what types of
            software the company offers, but also the pricing model the company
            uses for the development and use of the software. This is important
            information that the visitor can gather when they are exploring the
            different options available to them.

          <h3>Plan A</h3>
          <h2>$22</h2>
          <p>
            It is also important for the company to decide what what kind of
            pricing model would work or if they are confident enough to give a
            ballpark estimate of the price when they don't have the details
            about the company.

          <h2>$33</h2>
          <p>
            It is because of this that the website can have an easy way to
            request a quote with simple details about their needs that could
            either be ran through a formula to give them a good estimate or they
            contact the company directly to get an accurate quote.
